High‐Resolution Inundation Mapping for Heterogeneous Land Covers with Synthetic Aperture Radar and Terrain Data

Floods are one of the most wide‐spread, frequent, and devastating natural disasters that 
continue  to  increase  in  frequency  and  intensity.  Remote  sensing,  specifically  synthetic  aperture 
radar (SAR), has been widely used to detect surface water inundation to provide retrospective and 
near‐real  time  (NRT)  information  due  to  its  high‐spatial  resolution,  self‐illumination,  and  low 
atmospheric  attenuation.  However,  the  efficacy  of  flood  inundation  mapping  with  SAR  is 
susceptible to reflections and scattering from  a variety of factors including dense vegetation and 
urban areas. In this study, the topographic dataset Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) was 
investigated as a potential supplement to Sentinel‐1A C‐Band SAR along with supervised machine 
learning to improve  the  detection  of  inundation  in  heterogeneous  areas.  Three  machine  learning 
classifiers were trained on two sets of features dual‐polarized SAR only and dual‐polarized SAR 
along  with  HAND  to  map  inundated  areas.  Three  study  sites  along  the  Neuse  River  in  North 
Carolina, USA during the record flood of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 were selected. The 
binary  classification  analysis  (inundated  as  positive  vs.  non‐inundated  as  negative)  revealed 
significant  improvements  when  incorporating  HAND  in  several  metrics  including  classification 
accuracy (ACC) (+36.0%), critical success index (CSI) (+39.95%), true positive rate (TPR) (+42.02%), 
and negative predictive value (NPV) (+17.26%). A marginal change of +0.15% was seen for positive 
predictive  value  (PPV),  but  true  negative  rate  (TNR)  fell  −14.4%.  By  incorporating  HAND,  a 
significant  number  of  areas  with  high  SAR  backscatter  but  low  HAND  values  were  detected  as 
inundated which increased true positives. This in turn also increased the false positives detected 
but  to  a  lesser  extent  as  evident  in  the  metrics.  This  study  demonstrates  that  HAND  could  be 
considered a valuable feature to enhance SAR flood inundation mapping especially in areas with 
heterogeneous land covers with dense vegetation that interfere with SAR.
